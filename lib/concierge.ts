/**
 * @module
 * concierge.ts — in-box client for concierged (the --concierge door).
 *
 * Service-oriented delegation, replacing lib/spawn.ts's role: a box does not
 * launch a child that inherits its doors — it is INTRODUCED to a capability.
 * Providers `register` what they serve; consumers `resolve` a capability and get
 * back an attenuated DoorGrant they then `call()` peer-to-peer.
 *
 * ⚠️ PHASE 1 — PLUMBING, NOT A BOUNDARY (CONCIERGE.md §9). The resolved grant is
 * routing data: a door means it's reachable, not that you're authorized. The
 * boundary is the serving room verifying a SIGNED grant (prx, Phase 2) — not yet
 * wired. Don't treat a Phase-1 resolve as a non-bypassable capability.
 *
 *   import { resolve } from "./lib/concierge";
 *   import { call } from "./guest-room/protocol.ts";
 *   const scout = await resolve("scout", ["host=github.com"]);
 *   const body  = await call(scout.guest, "fetch", { url: "https://api.github.com/…" });
 *
 * See CONCIERGE.md.
